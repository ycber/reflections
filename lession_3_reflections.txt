When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If I am working from multiple computers ...
If I am collaborating with others ...
If I want to share the latest code ...

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Prevents errors.
