How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?
I could compare version a to v. b.
 
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?
I dont have to remeber every change, but let the computer rember changes. (In case of bugs or if i want to recreate an old solution.)

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
Pro:
The user can decide to save at milestones and isnt confused by tons of different autosafed versions.

Con:
It is easy to forget to save.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Perhaps to more easily resolve conflicts.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log --stat

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
The programmer always know he can go back to the working version.
Using diffs make it easier to keep the working changes.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Doind the course, later making an app.
